## Version 1.0.0
Work like a charm.

## Support

## Bug
- CSS not hot reload (Maybe due to stylus as the code work fine for scss)

For simple deploy it on *GitHub*. Feel free to use it. It still somehow bug thought.

## I don't use Pug nor Stylus
You can remove it as easy as you install by uninstall it and not use it in .vue. Also, change the webpack HTML to file your template of choice like .html.
