# Vue Boilerplate

## Disclaimer
The purpose of this project is for *me* to have a boilderplate that I know everything about every file be able to start the project by cloning from git.

## Version 0.1
Work like a charm.

## Will include in next iteration
- ENV file
- Vuex
- ActionScript
- UnitTest (karma + jasmine + phantom)
- Sample Code on UnitTesting
- E2E (nightwatch)
- Sample code on E2E
- Bug with include image when path presents.

## Can I use this boilderplate ?
Yes, but not recommend until 1.0.0. I also include some comment inside webpack in case you want to change it.

## What is this deploy.sh ?
For simple deploy it on *GitHub*. Feel free to use it. It still somehow bug thought.

## I don't use Pug nor Stylus
You can remove it as easy as you install by uninstall it and not use it in .vue. Also, change the webpack HTML to file your template of choice like .html.

## Why include Sass when already has Stylus
Import *Bulma* directly, it returns .sass. Of couse, I can get .css but my work place using sass anyway, so I include it.
